# ...i am become uberman.

Chronicle. Four.twenty-eight.twenty-sixteen. Two days to experiment.

Today is a Thursday. It's snowing outside. I'm in the basement of the home I grew up in. Appropriate and poetic since this is the place where every bad habit and attitude I have was conceived in this place.

Broke. Lazy. Disappointed... disappointment.

Finally, things will actually change.

Why?

Because of you. You're here now. Just knowing you exist will make me feel guilty enough to actually do something. 

Do what? Everything I've ever wanted to, and everything you say I can't.

This is to serve as a chronicle of my achievements. Think of it as the things I'm doing now that you never could. Where you have failed, or perhaps not even attempted, I shall succeed. 

I will be stronger than you. Faster than you. Smarter than you. Happier than you. I'll be awake hours before you hit the snooze button the third time, and as you go back to sleep, I'll be at my best.
